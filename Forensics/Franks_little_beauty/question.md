## Frank's little beauty

#### Frank has never been a "tech person". He reuses passwords, is too lazy to type, the whole nine yards. And it's just not tech, he's blind as a bat and about as sharp as a round ball too. I mean, he doesn't even know about the shortcut to paddys. Help his son Dennis sift through this memory dump and reconstruct the flag

Note: Use the Win7SP1x64 profile to analyse the dump. All relevant files for this challenge are only present in the C drive and in no other drive
